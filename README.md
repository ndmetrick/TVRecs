# TVRecs

This is a work-in-progress app for people to recommend TV shows to each other and keep track of shows they want to watch in the future. Users are able to add tags to their profile to describe the type of shows they like, and can add tags to the shows they're recommending to communicate how they would describe the show, things they love about it, and anything they want to warn potential viewers about.

The three types of lists you can have on your profile are your Recommendations (or 'Recs') list, Watch list (shows you want to keep track of to watch in the future), and Filter Out list (shows you never want to see recommended to you for whatever reason. Shows can only be on one of those lists at a time, and only your Rec list is visible to others. On the main feed page with recommendations from the users you follow, you can toggle on/off seeing shows recommended that you have on your profile on your To Watch and Recs lists (shows in Filter Out will never show up in your main feed).

As I said, this is a work in progress. I'm updating this with messy code publicly because I'm applying for jobs and I want to make clear what I've been working on. But it's not well commented yet, it's still got lots of console.logs, and it's got various bits of commented-out code.

This is the repo for the front end of this project. The back end is at https://github.com/ndmetrick/TVRecsAPI.

Also, if you've got an Android phone, you can also see the (often changing, sometimes buggy, not fully styled) current version of the app via Expo at https://expo.dev/@ndmetrick/TelevisionIsMyFriend. (You can download the Expo app and then use the QR code (from the camera on an iPhone or from within the Expo app on Android) to open the app. As it says in the app, most of it can't really be experienced without logging in, but you can try using the guest account if you don't want to create your own.) Also, feel free to email me with tag ideas -- the tag list is still very much in process also! For iPhones, I'm still working on getting the app into their testing app, and I'll update this page when I've added it (hopefully fairly soon).
