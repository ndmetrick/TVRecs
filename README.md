# TVRecs

This is a work-in-progress app for people to recommend TV shows to each other and keep track of shows they want to watch in the future. Users will be able to add tags to their profile to describe the type of TV watcher they are, and add tags to the shows they're recommending to communicate how they would describe the show, things they love about it, and any trigger warnings.

As I said, this is a work in progress. I'm updating this with messy code publicly because I'm applying for jobs and I want to make clear what I've been working on. But it's not well commented yet, it's riddled with console.logs, and it's currently halfway between the original Firebase database and the new Postgres database (as I developed the idea, it became clear that I would end up needing a relational database model).

This is the repo for the front end of this project. The back end is at https://github.com/ndmetrick/TVRecsAPI. Once it gets to the point of having tags (hopefully soon!) I'll make a note on the back end Readme for people to suggest any tags they think I should add :)
