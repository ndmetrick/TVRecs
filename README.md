# TVRecs

This is a work-in-progress app for people to recommend TV shows to each other and keep track of shows they want to watch in the future. Users are able to add tags to their profile to describe the type of shows they like, and can add tags to the shows they're recommending to communicate how they would describe the show, things they love about it, and anything they want to warn potential viewers about. 

(The three types of lists you can have on your profile are your Rec list (recommendations), Watch list (shows you want to keep track of to watch in the future), and Seen list (shows you want to mark as having seen but don't want to publicly recommend -- only your Rec list is visible to others. On the main feed page with recommendations from the users you follow, you can toggle on/off seeing shows recommended that you have on your own profile. So adding shows to the Seen list allows you to avoid seeing recommendations for things you've already seen but didn't necessarily like enough to recommend.)

As I said, this is a work in progress. I'm updating this with messy code publicly because I'm applying for jobs and I want to make clear what I've been working on. But it's not well commented yet, it's still got lots of console.logs, and it's got various bits of commented-out code.

This is the repo for the front end of this project. The back end is at https://github.com/ndmetrick/TVRecsAPI. 

You can also see the (often changing, sometimes buggy, not fully styled) current version of the app via Expo at https://expo.dev/@ndmetrick/TelevisionIsMyFriend. (You can download the Expo app and then use the QR code (from the camera on an iPhone or from within the Expo app on Android) to open the app. As it says in the app, most of it can't really be experienced without logging in, but you can try using the guest account if you don't want to create your own.) Also, feel free to email me with tag ideas -- the tag list is still very much in process also!
